🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Development Internship — Codveda Technologies
🚀 Overview

This repository documents my journey through the Full-Stack Development Internship at Codveda Technologies, where I built and deployed full-stack web applications using modern tools and frameworks.
Each level of this internship progressively enhanced my skills — from backend and frontend fundamentals to complete production-grade deployment.

🏗️ Level 1 — Basic
🧰 Task 1: Setup Development Environment

Objectives

Installed and configured Node.js and npm/yarn.

Set up Git and GitHub for version control.

Installed PostgreSQL as the primary database.

Practiced basic terminal and Git commands.

Outcome

A complete local development environment ready for backend and frontend projects.

⚙️ Task 2: Build a Simple REST API

Objectives

Created a Node.js + Express RESTful API.

Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for resources like users or products.

Tested endpoints with Postman or Thunder Client.

Added proper error handling and HTTP response codes.

Outcome

Built a functional backend service exposing RESTful endpoints.

🌐 Task 3: Frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Objectives

Designed a static website layout using HTML and CSS.

Used Fetch API or Axios to connect with the backend REST API.

Displayed dynamic data and handled basic user interactions.

Focused on responsiveness and clean styling.

Outcome

A working web page integrated with backend API responses.

⚛️ Level 2 — Intermediate
🧩 Task 1: Frontend with a JavaScript Framework (React)

Objectives

Rebuilt the frontend using React.js for component-based architecture.

Managed state with React hooks.

Integrated the backend API using Axios.

Built reusable UI components with loading and error states.

Outcome

A modular, scalable frontend application with modern UI/UX.

🔐 Task 2: Authentication and Authorization

Objectives

Implemented user authentication using JWT and bcrypt.

Secured routes based on user roles (Admin/User).

Stored tokens safely (HTTP-only cookies / localStorage).

Applied password hashing and validation.

Outcome

A secure login & signup system with role-based access control.

🗄️ Task 3: Database Integration

Objectives

Integrated PostgreSQL using Sequelize ORM.

Created models and defined relationships.

Implemented validation and indexing.

Performed CRUD operations through ORM.

Outcome

A persistent backend connected to a relational database.

💼 Level 3 — Advanced
🌍 Task 1: Full-Stack Application (PERN Stack)

Objectives

Built a PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node) full-stack app.

Implemented complete authentication and role-based authorization.

Deployed both frontend and backend (e.g., on Render/Vercel).

Optimized performance and API efficiency.

Outcome

A production-ready full-stack web application.

💬 Task 2: WebSockets for Real-Time Communication

Objectives

Implemented Socket.io for real-time messaging/notifications.

Enabled bidirectional communication between client and server.

Handled user-specific events.

Ensured scalability and real-time updates.

Outcome

Real-time communication integrated into the application.

🧠 Task 3: GraphQL API Development

Objectives

Built a GraphQL API using Apollo Server / Express-GraphQL.

Defined queries, mutations, and resolvers.

Secured API with JWT authentication.

Optimized data fetching and minimized over-fetching.

Outcome

Efficient GraphQL API for flexible data querying.

🧾 Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL (via Sequelize)
Other Tools: Docker, JWT, bcrypt, Socket.io, GraphQL, Git, Postman

🏁 Final Outcome

By the end of this program:

I mastered both frontend and backend technologies.

Built secure, database-driven web applications.

Learned deployment, authentication, and real-time communication.

Prepared a strong portfolio project to showcase full-stack capabilities.
